The character of the camp changed in March 1944 when a new section was established for sick male prisoners from other concentration camps who were no longer able to work. A section for female prisoners was set up in August 1944. In December 1944, the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp became the destination for numerous evacuation transports from other concentration camps.

{"id": "1280", "text": "27 August 1944\nOn the other hand, if it continues to rain, what will I do with my legs? You not get my drift, do you? That is because you do not know the meaning of space. You have a few cubic metres to yourself. You call it \u2018room\u2019. In that room you have placed some objects, called chairs and tables, and when you want to eat, you sit yourself at a table on a chair, and in such a way that every person in the room has a chair, and in front of him on the table enough space for his plate and a piece of bread. There are even chairs to spare in the room. When it rains, though \u2026 where and how must I eat then? When the sun shines, we sit outdoors. Outdoors there are tables, benches and stools. True, there is not enough room for everyone at once, but one can wait, or rather, can let another wait. When it rains, though, we are unable to sit outdoors. Indoors it is like a Jewish warehouse; the coffins in which we sleep are piled three high, with only twenty centimetres between them. So where must we eat then? We eat together, my wife and I. We sit on her bunk. Below us is a Greek tailor with his wife and child. Fortunately, there is no one above us yet. In my wife\u2019s hut the beds are still only two-tiered. Hence the Greek tailor together with his wife and child are able to sit below us, because there is adequate space between the first and the second bunks. If the beds are three-tiered, the legs of the beds have been shortened. The distance between the first two tiers is then most fifty centimetres, so that one can sit only on the top bunk. If you are lucky, there may even be a further ten centimetres or so of space between your head and the rafters. But in either case the problem is always one\u2019s legs. In our case, the Greek tailor and his wife are not at all pleased that we clamber on top to eat and sit there. The roads are muddy and dirty, and my shoes are like the road! And it is not pleasant to see the shoes of a fellow citizen dangling above your meagre soup, not once, but day after day, week after week, month after month, as they did last winter. The worthy pastor will say people ought to love one another. But the worthy pastor has void which he calls a room, his room, and he has a chair, his chair, and a table, his table. I should like to know what his love for mankind would be like if every morning, every afternoon and every evening my legs were to dangle above his slice of bread, his soup, his gravy, meat, vegetables, potatoes \u2013 an dessert. We long for some space. My Greek tailor does protest occasionally, but I think to myself: my dear man, you are an angel. And I am able to think it all the more, because I cannot understand the curses he undoubtedly casts my way.

We sit on these terribly hard stools at wooden tables amid piles of old shoes. The muggy, dusty air makes breathing difficult, and very soon your back begins to hurt from permanently sitting in a crouched position. Our daily quota is to rip up 40 pairs of old shoes, unstitch them seam for seam with unsuitable tools. The parts are then sorted and thrown into Wehrmacht helmets that have been provided for the purpose. Our diligent labour is supposed to win Germany the victory! One helmet is marked for reusable leather, another for scraps, and yet another for pieces of fabric. The \u201cgood\u201d pieces are those that the Germans want to make composition leather from. Our favourite helmet is the one intended for the leather scraps. It always fills up fastest, because cutting up good leather into small scraps is the only opportunity for sabotage open to us. The fabric, which sounds much too good a term for those dusty, dirty rags, is desperately needed in the latrines, but more on that later. In total, there may be around 600 men and women crouching over those shoes. Sure, the work may not really be all that hard, but crouching on a rickety wooden stool for eleven hours, hungry and freezing, that\u2019s enough to do us in. And then there\u2019s that awful dust. Your throat gets dry, your eyes get sore and your back hurts between the shoulder blades. I\u2019m sore from sitting down for so long, my stomach hurts, but what hurts the most is the pain I feel from doing this inhumane, useless and empty work.

On the way there they walk one behind the other in the midst of the dust kicked up by the bodies dragged over the ground, these horrifying groups of living ghosts; as they drag this unknown comrade by his four skeletal limbs to his final resting place, which will soon be theirs as well, his head bangs against the stones along the way and scrapes roughly along the earth.\u201d\n\nExcerpt from a personal account\n\nTranslated from the French", "topic": "The Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp and Its Prisoners", "label": "0_camp_prisoners_bergen_belsen", "x": 11.083685874938965, "y": 11.083685874938965}

Yesterday a transport made up of six Palestine lists comprising older men and women came to Hut 10 (where we were in quarantine). It\u2019s said that they are going to be exchanged to Palestine, something which provokes much discussion. The chance of exchange has passed for me, because it turns out that they will not take anyone fit for military service; the most I can hope for is internment. It was a barbaric process. The day before, Palestine people had to step forward during the work roll-call, a few bigwigs came along, someone read out the names of around 250 people who lined up. After that had gone on for about two hours, in the pouring rain, we who had not been called were allowed to go back home, and we earned ourselves an afternoon off, while those who had been called were given instructions. The next day, again at the work roll-call, which the non-workers were now also ordered to attend, another 250 people were called, but then some others as well who were given fifteen minutes time, all of them elderly or women and children. After that we marched to work without a farewell, not even from Uncle Abel; but there are also men whose wives are going away. The \u2018ten\u2019 are now strictly isolated from the rest of the camp, barbed wire and guards.

How they had been able to arrange this was a mystery to me, but we were very glad as now the older children could have some covers as well.[...] It was now half-past eleven. The chilly outside air penetrated the garage. Trucks could be heard coming down the road. They stopped in front of the garage, Then two SS officers and a female guard entered.

{"id": "1542", "text": "Prisoners from the Netherlands\nIn May 1940, the German Wehrmacht invaded the Netherlands. The Nazi regime created the \u201cReichskommissariat Niederlande\u201d, an administrative province of the German Reich, and tried to implement their policies through local institutions. The majority of Dutch people disliked the German occupation, and the German occupiers reacted with increasing brutality to the widespread disobedience and resistance. Soon, arbitrary raids, arrests and shootings became the order of the day. 120,000 Dutch people were deported to Germany for forced labour and thousands were imprisoned in the camps at Amersfoort and Vught, from where they were deported to German concentration camps.\r\nIn the Netherlands, Jews were more firmly integrated into mainstream society than in most other European countries. In 1941, around 140,000 Jews lived there, including 22,000 refugees, most of them from Germany. The new regulations brought in by the Germans pushed the Jews more and more to the margins of society, and in July 1942, the deportations started. More than 100,000 Jews were transported to the east via the Westerbork \u201cPolice Transit Camp for Jews\u201d. Most were taken directly to the Auschwitz or Sobib\u00f3r extermination camps, but around 4,000 Jews were transported to the Bergen-Belsen exchange camp. Fewer than 5,000 of those who were deported from Westerbork survived their time in the camps.\r\nPrisoners from the Netherlands were held in all camp sections of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.\r\nBetween September 1943 and September 1944, around 4,000 Jews were taken from Westerbork to the Bergen-Belsen exchange camp (Star Camp). Among these prisoners were many children and teenagers. The SS intended to use them as hostages for possible exchanges, but only around 400 of them were ever actually released. At least 948 of them died in Bergen-Belsen, and 1,000 Dutch prisoners were transported on to other camps.\r\nIn early April 1945, the exchange camp was evacuated and the prisoners, including 1,500 people who had been deported from Westerbork, were put on three large transports which left Bergen-Belsen for Theresienstadt. Most of them were liberated after a two-week odyssey near Tr\u00f6bitz in the Niederlausitz region in eastern Germany, while a smaller group was liberated at Farsleben near Magdeburg. Shortly before their liberation and in the weeks after, 200 people died of the consequences of their imprisonment and the additional strain of the evacuation transports.\r\nHenrik Abspoel, a political prisoner from The Hague, was given the prisoner number 1 at the Bergen-Belsen men\u2019s camp. He died at the age of 42 only nine days after his arrival in Bergen-Belsen. Over 300 other Dutch prisoners in the men\u2019s camp are known by name.\r\nMore than 100 women from the Netherlands were taken to the Bergen-Belsen women\u2019s camp from November 1944, including many Jewish women who had initially been deported to Auschwitz from Westerbork.\r\nIn total, well over 5,000 men, women and children from the Netherlands were imprisoned in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.\r\n", "topic": "The Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp and Its Prisoners", "label": "0_camp_prisoners_bergen_belsen", "x": 13.578554153442383, "y": 13.578554153442383}

The child sat by her mother as if turned to stone. Finally, she pulled the blanket over the legs and moved the kerchief into place. She went away with the red enamel cup of soup, alone. Her father had died of camp fever.\n\nDiary entry\n\nTranslated from the Dutch", "topic": "The Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp and Its Prisoners", "label": "0_camp_prisoners_bergen_belsen", "x": 12.20132064819336, "y": 12.20132064819336}
