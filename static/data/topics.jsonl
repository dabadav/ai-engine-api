Hut 9 was used as a depot, while hut 10 was initially used to house prisoners from the special camp. By the summer of 1944, however, a large number of these prisoners had been deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. The SS then also housed prisoners from the Hungarians’ camp in this hut. They were kept strictly separate from the few remaining special camp prisoners. In mid-January 1945, when the men’s camp was expanded, hut 10 became part of this camp section and was completely overcrowded with male prisoners.

Today, many consider it the embodiment of Nazi crimes. However, Bergen-Belsen differed from all other Nazi concentration camps in several key aspects. Bergen-Belsen was initially set up for Jewish hostages whom the SS had said they would release - in exchange for Germans interned abroad, foreign currency or commodities valuable to the war effort. The character of the camp changed in March 1944 when a new section was established for sick male prisoners from other concentration camps who were no longer able to work. A section for female prisoners was set up in August 1944. In December 1944, the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp became the destination for numerous evacuation transports from other concentration camps. The camp’s subsequent overcrowding and disastrous living conditions led to mass deaths which claimed the lives of around 18,000 victims in March 1945 alone. At least 52,000 of the total of around 120,000 prisoners in Bergen-Belsen died of starvation or disease, of the abuse they received from the SS, or of the immediate effects of their imprisonment following their liberation.","topic":"The Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp and Its Prisoners","label":"0_camp_prisoners_bergen_belsen","x":12.8435535431,"y":12.8435535431}

Many soldiers acted accordingly, others sometimes used the leeway they had to the to prisoners advantage.\r\n\r\nThe first guards squads to be deployed at Bergen-Belsen exchange camp came from the recently disbanded Niederhagen concentration camp.

{"id":1280,"text":"27 August 1944\nOn the other hand, if it continues to rain, what will I do with my legs? You not get my drift, do you? That is because you do not know the meaning of space. You have a few cubic metres to yourself. You call it ‘room’. In that room you have placed some objects, called chairs and tables, and when you want to eat, you sit yourself at a table on a chair, and in such a way that every person in the room has a chair, and in front of him on the table enough space for his plate and a piece of bread. There are even chairs to spare in the room. When it rains, though … where and how must I eat then? When the sun shines, we sit outdoors. Outdoors there are tables, benches and stools. True, there is not enough room for everyone at once, but one can wait, or rather, can let another wait. When it rains, though, we are unable to sit outdoors. Indoors it is like a Jewish warehouse; the coffins in which we sleep are piled three high, with only twenty centimetres between them. So where must we eat then? We eat together, my wife and I. We sit on her bunk. Below us is a Greek tailor with his wife and child. Fortunately, there is no one above us yet. In my wife’s hut the beds are still only two-tiered. Hence the Greek tailor together with his wife and child are able to sit below us, because there is adequate space between the first and the second bunks. If the beds are three-tiered, the legs of the beds have been shortened. The distance between the first two tiers is then most fifty centimetres, so that one can sit only on the top bunk. If you are lucky, there may even be a further ten centimetres or so of space between your head and the rafters. But in either case the problem is always one’s legs. In our case, the Greek tailor and his wife are not at all pleased that we clamber on top to eat and sit there. The roads are muddy and dirty, and my shoes are like the road! And it is not pleasant to see the shoes of a fellow citizen dangling above your meagre soup, not once, but day after day, week after week, month after month, as they did last winter. The worthy pastor will say people ought to love one another. But the worthy pastor has void which he calls a room, his room, and he has a chair, his chair, and a table, his table. I should like to know what his love for mankind would be like if every morning, every afternoon and every evening my legs were to dangle above his slice of bread, his soup, his gravy, meat, vegetables, potatoes – an dessert. We long for some space. My Greek tailor does protest occasionally, but I think to myself: my dear man, you are an angel.

Confined to her bed, heavy and inert like lead, she never gets up. All day long, I don't know what to do with my body; I can't get the slightest space in this damned bed to rest my slowly atrophying limbs a little. Breathing has become nearly impossible for me, too. \r\nIn the evening, I sink into our shared, damp hole on the lowest level of a bed whose upper two levels are occupied by three adults and two children. Our bed is right next to the wall, or rather, those worm-eaten planks that rain seeps through ceaselessly. The window and the door are also nearby. The dampness has penetrated everywhere, soaking everything, clothing, bodies, blankets... Things aren't damp here, they're drenched. Water and mud everywhere, inside and out. And along with them, the air saturated by the suffocating odor exhaled by those suffering from typhus and the stench of urine. Is this a bed? Call it what you want, but not a bed.

{"id":1284,"text":"22 April 1944\n“Saturday, 22 April 1944. […] The so-called shoe factory is located inside a brick-built stable. Around 120 women work in a single room. We sit on these terribly hard stools at wooden tables amid piles of old shoes. The muggy, dusty air makes breathing difficult, and very soon your back begins to hurt from permanently sitting in a crouched position. Our daily quota is to rip up 40 pairs of old shoes, unstitch them seam for seam with unsuitable tools. The parts are then sorted and thrown into Wehrmacht helmets that have been provided for the purpose. Our diligent labour is supposed to win Germany the victory! One helmet is marked for reusable leather, another for scraps, and yet another for pieces of fabric. The “good” pieces are those that the Germans want to make composition leather from. Our favourite helmet is the one intended for the leather scraps. It always fills up fastest, because cutting up good leather into small scraps is the only opportunity for sabotage open to us. The fabric, which sounds much too good a term for those dusty, dirty rags, is desperately needed in the latrines, but more on that later. In total, there may be around 600 men and women crouching over those shoes. Sure, the work may not really be all that hard, but crouching on a rickety wooden stool for eleven hours, hungry and freezing, that’s enough to do us in. And then there’s that awful dust. Your throat gets dry, your eyes get sore and your back hurts between the shoulder blades. I’m sore from sitting down for so long, my stomach hurts, but what hurts the most is the pain I feel from doing this inhumane, useless and empty work. And then there’s the eternal talk about food. People constantly think up new meals that never get served, or dream up ever more imaginative dishes they never taste. They don’t talk about anything else but food! The only relief from this monotonous daily routine is when you get to secretly smoke a cigarette during latrine break. The latrine is a simple wooden cabin with an iron bar over a cesspit, and this is also where all the political rumours originate that are flying around the camp.” \n\nDiary entry\n\nTranslated from the Dutch","topic":"The Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp and Its Prisoners","label":"0_camp_prisoners_bergen_belsen","x":11.2691364288,"y":11.2691364288}

Before it was a disorganized life, now we started to be organized evil. He threw out the Russian prisoners of war from barracks that were not far from our camp. Where they were sent I don't know. We were transported to these barracks. There was an old doctor there, Dr. Schnable, who was coming to us everyday and he ordered us to organize a so called hospital. Well, if you speak about a hospital, why do I say so called hospital? Because there was only one barrack that had berths three tiers high. All the other patients were sleeping on the floor. There were two barracks that had thousand women on the floor. [...] People came to us from Auschwitz and from other camps. They came sick and exhausted.

{"id":1542,"text":"Prisoners from the Netherlands\nIn May 1940, the German Wehrmacht invaded the Netherlands. The Nazi regime created the “Reichskommissariat Niederlande”, an administrative province of the German Reich, and tried to implement their policies through local institutions. The majority of Dutch people disliked the German occupation, and the German occupiers reacted with increasing brutality to the widespread disobedience and resistance. Soon, arbitrary raids, arrests and shootings became the order of the day. 120,000 Dutch people were deported to Germany for forced labour and thousands were imprisoned in the camps at Amersfoort and Vught, from where they were deported to German concentration camps.\r\nIn the Netherlands, Jews were more firmly integrated into mainstream society than in most other European countries. In 1941, around 140,000 Jews lived there, including 22,000 refugees, most of them from Germany. The new regulations brought in by the Germans pushed the Jews more and more to the margins of society, and in July 1942, the deportations started. More than 100,000 Jews were transported to the east via the Westerbork “Police Transit Camp for Jews”. Most were taken directly to the Auschwitz or Sobibór extermination camps, but around 4,000 Jews were transported to the Bergen-Belsen exchange camp. Fewer than 5,000 of those who were deported from Westerbork survived their time in the camps.\r\nPrisoners from the Netherlands were held in all camp sections of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.\r\nBetween September 1943 and September 1944, around 4,000 Jews were taken from Westerbork to the Bergen-Belsen exchange camp (Star Camp). Among these prisoners were many children and teenagers. The SS intended to use them as hostages for possible exchanges, but only around 400 of them were ever actually released. At least 948 of them died in Bergen-Belsen, and 1,000 Dutch prisoners were transported on to other camps.\r\nIn early April 1945, the exchange camp was evacuated and the prisoners, including 1,500 people who had been deported from Westerbork, were put on three large transports which left Bergen-Belsen for Theresienstadt. Most of them were liberated after a two-week odyssey near Tröbitz in the Niederlausitz region in eastern Germany, while a smaller group was liberated at Farsleben near Magdeburg. Shortly before their liberation and in the weeks after, 200 people died of the consequences of their imprisonment and the additional strain of the evacuation transports.\r\nHenrik Abspoel, a political prisoner from The Hague, was given the prisoner number 1 at the Bergen-Belsen men’s camp. He died at the age of 42 only nine days after his arrival in Bergen-Belsen. Over 300 other Dutch prisoners in the men’s camp are known by name.\r\nMore than 100 women from the Netherlands were taken to the Bergen-Belsen women’s camp from November 1944, including many Jewish women who had initially been deported to Auschwitz from Westerbork.\r\nIn total, well over 5,000 men, women and children from the Netherlands were imprisoned in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.\r\n","topic":"The Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp and Its Prisoners","label":"0_camp_prisoners_bergen_belsen","x":13.5785541534,"y":13.5785541534}

{"id":1580,"text":"Exchange\nAfter the outbreak of the war, some Jewish nationals of either neutral or pro-German states still remained in the German sphere of control. These Jews were imprisoned in camps but were initially spared deportation to the extermination camps. In the autumn of 1942, the German Foreign Office, in an attempt to avoid possible conflict, began to contact the respective governments and asked them to “repatriate” their subjects. The states in question, which included Spain and Turkey, then began to consider whether or not to recognise the nationalities of the prisoners. \r\nExchanges of internees between the German Reich and Britain had already occurred in 1941 and 1942. On these occasions, Jews with papers for Palestine imprisoned in Germany had been released in exchange for German nationals interned in Palestine. The SS and the German Foreign Office intended to use the Bergen-Belsen prisoners to expand this exchange. \r\nAfter the mass deportations of Hungarian Jews to the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp had begun, Rezsö (Rudolf) Kasztner conducted negotiations with the SS on behalf of the Budapest-based Aid and Rescue Committee regarding the rescue of Jews.\r\nIm Zusammenhang all dieser Verhandlungsversuche wurden insgesamt knapp 2500 Menschen aus Bergen-Belsen freigelassen.\r\n","topic":"The Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp and Its Prisoners","label":"0_camp_prisoners_bergen_belsen","x":13.9452943802,"y":13.9452943802}

Most of them had passports from Latin American countries. However, when approached by the German Foreign Office, the Latin American governments refused to recognise the majority of these papers. In the eyes of the Foreign Office and the SS the prisoners had thus lost their value. In October 1943, the SS selected around 1,800 prisoners and told them they would be transferred to a camp called Bergau for an eventual exchange. Instead, the group was taken on a transport to the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp, where all of its members were murdered upon arrival.\r\nIn February and May 1944, another 350 prisoners from the Bergen-Belsen Special Camp were taken to Auschwitz.\r\n\r\nIn early April 1945, the SS evacuated the vast majority of prisoners from the exchange camp. Between 6 and 10 April 1945, around 6,700 prisoners were to be taken on three trains, probably to the Theresienstadt ghetto. However, only one of these transports actually arrived in Theresienstadt, where the prisoners were liberated on 8 May by Soviet troops. The other two trains were liberated on 13 April near Farsleben by American troops and on 23 April near Tröbitz by Soviet troops.\r\nThese transports were an additional strain on the already weakened prisoners. In the train liberated near Tröbitz alone, at least 133 prisoners died during the journey. In total, several hundred prisoners of the exchange camp lost their lives during the evacuation transports and the first weeks after liberation.","topic":"The Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp and Its Prisoners","label":"0_camp_prisoners_bergen_belsen","x":13.7419319153,"y":13.7419319153}

Her eyes were pasted together by lice dirt, the little legs thick with edema. She sat with her mother, forced the exhausted woman to swallow a piece of lukewarm turnip. Then with a guilty and greedy face, the child ate the rest of the mother's portion. The mother had pushed away the blanket, as it pressed too heavily on her swollen legs. Those legs on the gray campblanket looked like glassy white columns. The handkerchief on her head had been disarranged, showing the gray shaven skin. The child was crying. The mother had been a famous beauty from a Jewish section in Amsterdam. The child went to get some floury soup. She said, 'Mother, there is soup tonight.' The mother did not answer. Her small, thick hand hung over the edge of the bed. I saw wet spots on the floor; from her swollen hand, water was dripping. When the child came back, the mother was dead. The child sat by her mother as if turned to stone. Finally, she pulled the blanket over the legs and moved the kerchief into place. She went away with the red enamel cup of soup, alone. Her father had died of camp fever.\n\nDiary entry\n\nTranslated from the Dutch","topic":"The Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp and Its Prisoners","label":"0_camp_prisoners_bergen_belsen","x":12.2013206482,"y":12.2013206482}
{"id":1625,"text":"Death in the camp\nThe prisoners experienced every form of violence at the concentration camp, as witnesses and victims. The brutal and indiscriminate treatment the SS meted out to them posed a constant threat to them.\r\nBut hunger was the worst enemy: it became the defining element in the lives of all the prisoners and knew no age limit. The prisoners were given less and less to eat. The existential crisis worsened, and more than ever before the children were reliant on the support of older prisoners or their own initiative to obtain food.\r\nAs prisoner numbers increased and food rations deteriorated, more and more diseases and epidemics swept through the camp from autumn 1944 onwards. Prisoners lost their family members and friends – and death became a part of their everyday lives. Typhus and typhoid fever claimed many victims. The prisoners were too weak and malnourished to fight these diseases. The mortality rate soared, among adults as among children.","topic":"The Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp and Its Prisoners","label":"0_camp_prisoners_bergen_belsen","x":12.6408376694,"y":12.6408376694}

They were forced to live in the camp because they did not want to return to their countries of origin and they had no prospects for emigration. In light of this, they were in urgent need of diversion and occupation, sports and entertainment. Such activities helped the DPs deal with the traumatic events from the time of their imprisonment and enabled them to counter their worries about the future with positive experiences. In both the Polish and Jewish DP camps there were film screenings, musical performances, orchestras, theatre groups and sporting events.\r\nThe cinema was used for many of these activities, as well as for political meetings and conferences organised by the displaced persons.","topic":"The Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp and Its Prisoners","label":"0_camp_prisoners_bergen_belsen","x":13.1813869476,"y":13.1813869476}

Eventually, around 3,000 British soldiers were deployed to Bergen-Belsen. They were supported by units of the British Red Cross and other relief organisations, as well as by many volunteers.

The PoWs were guarded by soldiers who could not be deployed to the front because of their age or physical afflications. The camps' headquarters were staffed with reserve officers, many of whom were over 60 years old and had already served in World War I. The guidelines for the conduct towards Soviet POWs issued by the Wehrmacht High Command demanded a ruthless treatment of these prisoners without any respect for martial or international law. Many soldiers acted accordingly, others sometimes used the leeway they had to the to prisoners advantage.\r\n\r\nThe first guards squads to be deployed at Bergen-Belsen exchange camp came from the recently disbanded Niederhagen concentration camp.
